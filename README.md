Uber Eats, a global food delivery platform developed by Uber Technologies, launched its operations in Kenya in 2018. Initially starting in Nairobi, the service gradually expanded to other major urban centers such as Mombasa and Nakuru. By partnering with local restaurants and leveraging the Uber transport network, Uber Eats offered users convenient access to food delivery through a mobile app or website.
Despite its presence in a few select towns and cities, Uber Eats has expressed a strong interest in scaling its operations across the country. To support this expansion, the company has been running a nationwide marketing campaign primarily through social media platforms to boost visibility, attract new users, and increase customer engagement.
This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these social media advertisements in driving Uber Eats usage across Kenya, focusing on customer behavior, spending patterns, and regional uptake during the ongoing campaign.
