# Market-Research-Using-SPSS
This project evaluates the impact of social media advertisements on Uber Eats usage across various regions in Kenya, SPSS anaysis used to uncover user behavior trends and marketing effectiveness. 
## Introduction
Uber Eats, a global food delivery platform developed by Uber Technologies, launched its operations in Kenya in 2018. Initially starting in Nairobi, the service gradually expanded to other major urban centers such as Mombasa and Nakuru. By partnering with local restaurants and leveraging the Uber transport network, Uber Eats offered users convenient access to food delivery through a mobile app or website.
Despite its presence in a few select towns and cities, Uber Eats has expressed a strong interest in scaling its operations across the country. To support this expansion, the company has been running a nationwide marketing campaign primarily through social media platforms to boost visibility, attract new users, and increase customer engagement.
This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these social media advertisements in driving Uber Eats usage across Kenya, focusing on customer behavior, spending patterns, and regional uptake during the ongoing campaign.

## Project Objectives
-	Evaluate the impact of social media ad exposure on the frequency of Uber Eats usage among customers across different regions in Kenya.
-	Analyze the relationship between ad exposure and customer spending behavior, including average spend per order and total monthly expenditure.
-	Assess regional and demographic differences in response to Uber Eats’ national marketing campaign to identify high engagement segments.
## Key Findings of the Survey
- Nairobi is the largest Uber Eats consumer base.
- Digital ads, especially on Facebook and Instagram, are effective in increasing usage and spending.
- The 26–35 age group is most responsive to marketing.
- Ad exposure significantly increases spending, as proven by both t-test and regression results.
- Satisfaction levels are not directly influenced by ad exposure.

# Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics help summarize and describe the basic features of the data in your study.
## Distribution of Gender of the Customers
A total of 3,578 respondents participated in the Uber Eats Market Research Survey. As shown, the majority of respondents identified as male (n = 1,931, 54.0%), followed by female respondents (n = 1,622, 45.3%). A small proportion of respondents identified as other or preferred not to disclose their gender (n = 25, 0.7%).

## Regional Distribution of Customers
The Uber Eats Market Research Survey was completed by 3,578 respondents from various regions in Kenya. The bar chart presents the distribution of respondents by region. Nairobi had the highest representation (n = 1,326, 37.1%), followed by the Coast (n = 729, 20.4%) and Rift Valley (n = 713, 19.9%). The regions with the lowest representation were Western (n = 153, 4.3%), Eastern (n = 160, 4.5%), and Central (n = 163, 4.6%).

## Ads Exposed vs Not Exposed
Among the 3,578 Uber Eats survey respondents, 2,351 (65.7%) reported being exposed to advertising, while 1,227 (34.3%) indicated no exposure. Exposure was measured across various platforms including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and others.

## Social Media Advertising Platform Distribution
Respondents who were exposed to Uber Eats advertisements (n = 2,351) reported encountering ads across a range of social media platforms. As shown, the most frequently cited platform was Facebook (n = 689, 29.3% of total respondents), followed by Instagram (n = 609, 25.6%), TikTok (n = 449, 18.7%), Twitter (n = 368, 15.4%), and YouTube (n = 236, 9.9%).

# Inferential statistics  
To draw conclusions beyond the descriptive data, inferential statistical analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between key variables related to Uber Eats user behavior. Specifically, the study aimed to determine whether exposure to advertisements influenced frequency of use, satisfaction levels, and total spending on the platform. Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the strength and direction of linear relationships between variables, while independent samples t-tests were employed to compare mean differences between users who were exposed to advertisements and those who were not. In addition, linear regression analysis was conducted to predict the effect of advertisement exposure on total spending behavior. All tests were conducted at a 95% confidence level (α = .05).

## Corelation Statistics 
A Pearson product-moment correlation was conducted to examine the relationships between advertisement exposure, frequency of use, and satisfaction score. Results indicated a moderate, positive correlation between advertisement exposure and frequency of use, r(3576) = .472, p < .001, suggesting that individuals exposed to Uber Eats ads tended to use the service more frequently.

There was no significant correlation between advertisement exposure and satisfaction score, r(3576) = –.011, p = .525. Similarly, the relationship between frequency of use and satisfaction score was weak and non-significant, r(3576) = .016, p = .328.

## Independent Sample T test 
Independent samples t-tests were conducted to compare frequency of use and total spending between respondents who were exposed to advertisements and those who were not.

Frequency of Use
There was a statistically significant difference in frequency of use between users exposed to advertisements (M = higher) and those not exposed, t(3576) = –32.02, p < .001. The mean difference was –2.08 (SE = 0.065), indicating that ad-exposed users reported using Uber Eats more frequently.

Total Spending
Similarly, a significant difference was observed in total spending between the two groups, t(3576) = –33.06, p < .001. Those exposed to advertisements spent significantly more on Uber Eats (M = higher), with a mean difference of –KES 2,111.18 (SE = 63.86), 95% CI [–2,236.38, –1,985.98].

## Regression Analysis
A simple linear regression was conducted to examine whether exposure to advertisements significantly predicted total spending on Uber Eats. The results indicated that the model was statistically significant, F(1, 3576) = 1,092.97, p < .001, and accounted for approximately 23.4% of the variance in total spending, R² = .234.

The regression coefficient for advertisement exposure was significant, B = 2,111.18, SE = 63.86, t = 33.06, p < .001, indicating that being exposed to advertisements was associated with an average increase of KES 2,111.18 in total Uber Eats spending.

These results suggest that advertisement exposure is a strong and significant predictor of customer spending, highlighting the effectiveness of marketing in influencing purchasing behavior on the Uber Eats platform.

# Recommendations
- Increase targeted advertising in Nairobi and the Coast to maximize ROI.
- Focus campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, especially among 18–35-year-olds.
- Implement region-specific ad strategies for underperforming zones like Western and Eastern regions.
- Use retargeting ads to reinforce brand loyalty in frequent users.
- Integrate customer feedback to improve satisfaction independently from marketing.
# Conclusion
The Uber Eats market research confirms that advertising positively impacts customer frequency and spending. However, satisfaction is influenced by other factors beyond advertising. A data-driven approach targeting responsive regions and age groups can enhance market performance and revenue.
